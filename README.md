=======
index.js
=======
The index.js code is used to import React and ReactDOM, the App component and the AppProvider component from the index.js file. It also imports the CSS file from the same directory.

It then creates a root element in the DOM to render the App component. It also renders the App component inside the AppProvider component, which is used to provide the context for the application. The React.StrictMode component is used to activate additional checks and warnings for the React application.


=======
App.js
=======
The App component is responsible for rendering the main components of the application. It imports the Nav and CartContainer components and renders them within the main element.

The Nav component is responsible for rendering the navigation bar of the application. This can include links to other pages, a search bar, and other features.

The CartContainer component contains the logic for managing the cart and its items. This component handles the adding and removing of items from the cart, as well as updating the total amount. It also renders the cart items and the total amount.

The App component is the main entry point for the application. It renders the Nav and CartContainer components, which in turn render the other components necessary for the application.

================
CartContainer.js
================
The cartContainer.js is a React functional component that uses the useGlobalContext hook to get the cart and total from the global context. The component first checks if the cart is empty and if it is, it renders a message telling the user that the cart is empty. If the cart is not empty, the component maps through the cart items and renders a CartItem component for each item. It also renders a footer with the total cost of the items and a button to clear the cart. The component uses the useGlobalContext hook to get the cart and total from the global context. The useGlobalContext hook is used to access the data stored in the global context and make it available to the component. The component also uses the map method to iterate through the items in the cart and render a CartItem component for each item. Finally, the component renders a footer with the total cost of the items and a button to clear the cart.

===========
CartItem.js
===========
The CartItem.js is a React component that is used to display an item in a cart. The first line imports the React library, which allows us to use JSX and other React features such as components and hooks. The next line imports the useGlobalContext hook from the context module. This hook allows us to access the global context, which includes functions for manipulating the cart. 

The CartItem component has props for the item's id, price, title, image, and amount. These props are then used to render the item's details in the HTML. There are also two buttons, one to increase the amount of the item and one to decrease the amount. The increase and decrease functions are imported from the global context. Finally, there is a button to remove the item from the cart, which uses the removeItem function imported from the global context.

==========
context.js
==========
The context.js code is a React custom hook that uses the useReducer, useEffect and useContext hooks. 
The useReducer hook is used to create a global state for the app and the reducer is used to update the state. 
The useEffect hook is used to fetch data from an external API and the useContext hook is used to provide access to the state globally. 
The AppProvider component is used to wrap the entire application and provide access to the global state.
The useGlobalContext custom hook is used to access the global state from any component in the application.

=======
data.js
=======
in this code Export const cartItem is a Javascript ES6 statement used to declare a constant variable. This statement will create a constant called cartItem and will assign an array of 3 objects containing a list of items to be added to the cart. Each object contains the id, title, price, image, and amount of each item. The constant is being exported so that it can be used in other parts of the application.

=======
Nav.js
=======
The Nav.js code is a functional component which is used to render a navbar on a web page. The first line imports the React library from the 'react' package. This allows us to use React components and JSX syntax in our code. The second line imports the useGlobalContext hook from the './context' package. This hook allows us to access the global context in our component.

In the Nav component, we use the useGlobalContext hook to destructure the amount from the global context. The amount is then displayed in a p tag. Finally, the Nav component is exported, allowing it to be used in other components.

==========
reducer.js
==========
Here export const reducer is a function that takes two parameters, state and action. It uses a series of if statements to check the action.type field of the action parameter and if it matches a specific type, it will execute the code inside the if statement. 

For example, if action.type === "DISPLAY", the reducer will return a new state object with the cart field set to the payload of the action. For action.type === "CLEAR-ITEMS", the reducer will return a new state object with the cart field set to an empty array.
